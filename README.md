This is a Deep Convolutional GAN . The aim is to train a basic GAN on images of celebrities and generate new images. The dataset used is the celebA dataset from kaggle.
The output image are not so discernible because I could only train the model on very limited images for 5-6 epochs due to computational constraints.
The generated images however show that the model learned the pattern of eyes and mouth in faces pretty well.
